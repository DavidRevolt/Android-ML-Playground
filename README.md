An Android app built with MVVM architecture, utilizing **CameraX** and **Google ML Kit** for real-time image analysis.

The app features multiple detectors: a custom object detector using an **EfficientNet** custom model, a general object detector using a pre-built MLKit model and a face detector.
**It displays a live camera feed with overlay effects showing detection details** (e.g., bounding boxes and probability of smiling for face detection).

The app is **modularized**, allowing the CameraX module to be imported into other existing apps.
It leverages **Hilt** for dependency injection, **Jetpack Compose** for UI, **Kotlin** as the programming language, and **Google Accompanist** for runtime permissions support.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Live Camera Feed**: Real-time preview powered by CameraX framework.
- **Multiple Image Detectors**:
    - **Custom Object Detector**: Uses a custom EfficientNet model.
    - **General Object Detector**: Uses ML Kit's pre-built model.
    - **Face Detector**: Detects faces with facial landmarks and expressions (e.g., smile detection).
- **Dynamic Detector Selection**: Users can switch between detectors.
- **Overlay Effects for Detection Results**: Draw bounding boxes and detection details (e.g., confidence scores) on the live feed.
- **Camera Lens Switching**: Toggle between front and back cameras.
- **Generic Programming**: New ML Kit detectors (e.g., Barcode, Pose Detector) can be easily integrated.
- **Modular Design**: CameraX module can be easily imported into other apps for camera-based image analysis.
